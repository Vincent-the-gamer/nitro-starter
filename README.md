# Nitro starter
Starter of nitro server.

Nitro: [https://nitro.unjs.io/](https://nitro.unjs.io/)

# Why
I got an error from running: 
```shell
pnpm dlx giget@latest nitro nitro-app --install
```

This is caused by a popular problem in China, because `raw.githubusercontent.com` has been banned.

So I created this repo with some custom configuration.

# Usage
Generate a new repo using this template, or clone to local.

```shell
# dev
pnpm run dev

# build
pnpm run build
```
